Disclosapage
============

Version 1.1

Author: Robert Sinton

Disclosapage adds disclosure controls to MojoMotor's page manipulation tree.


Installation
------------

Copy the entire folder (as 'disclosapage') into the addons folder (system/mojomotor/thirdparty).


Usage
-----

To activate the addon, you must click the MojoBar Pages button while sitting on a layout that includes this tag:

{mojo:disclosapage:start}

If you have an 'Embed Content' layout that is used as a universal header or footer, that is an ideal place to put that tag.


Known Issues
------------

If you remove all subpages from a page in the tree,
you will still see a disclosure control until the next tie the tree is redisplayed.
